## description
The Coffee Shop Chatbot is an AI-powered assistant designed to enhance customer experience within a coffee shop mobile or web application. It provides detailed information about menu items using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Pinecone, ensuring accurate responses to customer queries. The chatbot also offers personalized item recommendations through market basket analysis using the Apriori algorithm, tailored to new and returning users. It efficiently manages the order-taking process by structuring order details, calculating total price, and listing item quantities. Additionally, a built-in Guard Agent ensures safe, relevant interactions by filtering out inappropriate or harmful queries.
